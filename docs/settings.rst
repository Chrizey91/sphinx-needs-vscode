Settings
========

In order to use this extension, you must configure the following settings.

.. _needsJsonPath:

sphinx-needs.needsJson
----------------------

Specify **Needs Json** path. This **Needs Json** file is generated by building your Sphinx-Needs project.

It can be generated automatically by config `needs_build_json <https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#needs-build-json>`_,
or manually by `build needs <https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builders.html#needs>`_.

.. _srcDir:

sphinx-needs.srcDir
-------------------

Specify **source directory** of current Sphinx-Needs project. Normally it is the directory that contains **conf.py**.

Example HowTo
-------------

There are two ways to config the settings in the following:

* Open your **.vscode/settings.json**, specify the path for those two above settings there.
